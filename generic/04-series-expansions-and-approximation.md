## When You Need This

In perturbation theory (III·1), energies are written as $E = E^{(0)} + \lambda E^{(1)} + \lambda^2 E^{(2)} + \cdots$. That is a Taylor series. In the WKB chapter (III·4), the expansion is in powers of $\hbar$. That is an asymptotic series. Both methods depend on the same question: is the small parameter actually small, and what is lost by stopping at second order? This module provides the tools to answer that question.

## The Taylor Series in One Formula

Any sufficiently smooth function $f$ can be reconstructed near a point $a$ from its derivatives there:

$$f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!}(x-a)^n.$$

When $a = 0$ this is the **Maclaurin series**. The coefficients $f^{(n)}(0)/n!$ are determined uniquely — they are the unique polynomial that matches every derivative of $f$ at the expansion point. The factorial $n!$ appears because differentiating $x^n$ exactly $n$ times brings down $n\cdot(n-1)\cdots1$.

## The Three Series Everything Rests On

All three converge for every real $x$:

$$e^x = 1 + x + \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^3}{3!} + \cdots$$

$$\sin x = x - \frac{x^3}{3!} + \frac{x^5}{5!} - \frac{x^7}{7!} + \cdots \quad \text{(odd powers, alternating signs)}$$

$$\cos x = 1 - \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^4}{4!} - \frac{x^6}{6!} + \cdots \quad \text{(even powers, alternating signs)}$$

These are not independent. Euler's formula $e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta$ (Module M-01) is obtained by substituting $x = i\theta$ into the exponential series and sorting by real and imaginary parts.

## Small-Parameter Expansions: Truncate and Bound the Error

We can keep the first few terms and treat the result as an approximation. The first term discarded gives an estimate of the error.

**Small-angle:** From the sine series, $\sin\theta \approx \theta$. The next term is $-\theta^3/6$, so the relative error is approximately $\theta^2/6$ (radians). At $15° = 0.262$ rad this is about 1%; at $5°$ it is 0.1%. The approximation is the series truncated after one term, with a computable error.

From the cosine series: $\cos\theta \approx 1 - \theta^2/2$.

**Binomial approximation:** For $|x| \ll 1$ and any real $n$:

$$(1+x)^n \approx 1 + nx.$$

Special cases: $\sqrt{1+x} \approx 1 + x/2$; $(1-x)^{-1} \approx 1 + x$. This simplifies relativistic corrections, perturbative denominators, and most "keep the leading term" calculations in QM.

## Every Smooth Potential Near a Minimum Is a Harmonic Oscillator

This is one of the most important applications of Taylor expansion in physics. Expanding any potential $V(x)$ about its minimum at $x_0$:

$$V(x) = V(x_0) + \underbrace{V'(x_0)}_{=\,0}(x-x_0) + \tfrac{1}{2}V''(x_0)(x-x_0)^2 + \cdots$$

The linear term vanishes at a minimum. Dropping cubic and higher terms (valid for small displacements) gives a harmonic potential with spring constant $k_\text{eff} = V''(x_0)$ and oscillation frequency $\omega = \sqrt{V''(x_0)/m}$. Every molecular bond, every lattice site, every potential well behaves like a quantum harmonic oscillator to leading order — which is why QHO perturbation theory serves as the universal reference system.

## Convergence: The Practical Picture

Every power series has a radius of convergence. Inside it, adding terms gives better and better approximations to the function; outside, the partial sums diverge. The series for $e^x$, $\sin x$, and $\cos x$ converge everywhere. The geometric series $1/(1-x) = 1 + x + x^2 + \cdots$ converges only for $|x| < 1$. A truncated series is reliable near the expansion point and progressively less accurate farther away — which is precisely why "small angle" must be small.

## Worked Example: Second-Order Period Correction for the Pendulum

The pendulum equation $\ddot\theta = -(g/L)\sin\theta$ is nonlinear and has no closed-form solution. Replacing $\sin\theta$ by its one-term Taylor series gives $\ddot\theta \approx -(g/L)\theta$, a harmonic oscillator with period $T_0 = 2\pi\sqrt{L/g}$. Carrying the cubic correction $-\theta^3/6$ through a perturbative expansion of the motion yields [verify]:

$$T \approx T_0\!\left(1 + \frac{\theta_0^2}{16}\right).$$

The correction is order $\theta_0^2$ — the same as the squared-angle error estimated from the dropped term. For $\theta_0 = 0.5$ rad the correction is 1.6% — small but measurable, and a direct confirmation that "small angle" was a truncation all along.

## In the Quantum Series

### Perturbation Theory Is a Taylor Expansion in the Coupling

Time-independent perturbation theory (III·1) begins with $\hat H(\lambda) = \hat H_0 + \lambda\hat H'$ where $\lambda$ is a small dimensionless coupling. The exact energy eigenvalue $E_n(\lambda)$ is a smooth function of $\lambda$ with Taylor expansion:

$$E_n(\lambda) = E_n^{(0)} + \lambda E_n^{(1)} + \lambda^2 E_n^{(2)} + \cdots$$

The first-order correction is the first derivative of $E_n$ with respect to $\lambda$ at $\lambda = 0$:

$$E_n^{(1)} = \langle n^{(0)}|\hat H'|n^{(0)}\rangle.$$

The second-order correction is

$$E_n^{(2)} = \sum_{m\neq n}\frac{|\langle m^{(0)}|\hat H'|n^{(0)}\rangle|^2}{E_n^{(0)} - E_m^{(0)}}.$$

Recognizing this as a Taylor series tells us when the method is valid: the expansion converges when $\lambda$ is small, which concretely means

$$\left|\frac{\langle m^{(0)}|\hat H'|n^{(0)}\rangle}{E_n^{(0)} - E_m^{(0)}}\right| \ll 1 \quad \text{for all }m\neq n.$$

This is the convergence check of the underlying series. Degenerate perturbation theory is required precisely when a denominator vanishes — the series has reached the boundary of its radius of convergence, and the expansion must be reorganized before truncating. Every formula in III·1 is a Taylor coefficient; understanding this converts the perturbation expansion from a list of results to memorize into a structure to understand.

### WKB Is an Asymptotic Series in $\hbar$

The WKB approximation (III·4) is the leading term of a systematic expansion of the wavefunction in powers of $\hbar$. Writing $\psi(x) = e^{iS(x)/\hbar}$ and substituting into the Schrödinger equation, then expanding $S(x) = S_0(x) + \hbar S_1(x) + \hbar^2 S_2(x) + \cdots$ gives equations for each order. The leading-order result yields the WKB wavefunction

$$\psi(x) \approx \frac{A}{\sqrt{p(x)}}\,e^{\pm(i/\hbar)\int p(x)\,dx}, \qquad p(x) = \sqrt{2m[E-V(x)]},$$

in classically allowed regions. The prefactor $1/\sqrt{p}$ comes from the $\hbar S_1$ correction.

The expansion breaks down near **turning points** where $p(x) \to 0$ — exactly where the small parameter $\hbar|p'/p^2|$ ceases to be small. This is a radius-of-convergence failure: the WKB series is asymptotic in $\hbar$, meaning it formally diverges if enough terms are included, yet the first few terms give excellent approximations for small $\hbar$. Connection formulas across turning points are required because the WKB series is not valid there.

## Conventions and Pitfalls

**Radians only.** The series $\sin x = x - x^3/6 + \cdots$ holds only when $x$ is in radians. The small-angle approximation $\sin\theta \approx \theta$ does not apply when $\theta$ is in degrees.

**The expansion point matters.** Perturbation theory expands about $\lambda = 0$ (no perturbation). WKB expands the potential locally about each point. Choosing the wrong center invalidates the approximation entirely, even when the truncation order is correct.

**Asymptotic vs. convergent.** The WKB series in $\hbar$ is asymptotic — it diverges if all terms are kept, yet truncated at the right order it is highly accurate. This differs from the Taylor series of $\sin x$, which converges everywhere. Adding more terms does not always improve accuracy in asymptotic series.

**Degeneracy is a convergence failure.** When two unperturbed levels are nearly degenerate, the denominator $E_n^{(0)} - E_m^{(0)}$ is small and the ratio $|\langle m|\hat H'|n\rangle|/(E_n^{(0)} - E_m^{(0)})$ can be large even for small $\hat H'$. The series has left its radius of convergence. Degenerate perturbation theory reorganizes the expansion to start from the correct zeroth-order basis — analogous to expanding about the right point $a$ rather than a distant one.

**"Higher-order corrections" = next Taylor coefficient.** Writing $E(\lambda)$ explicitly as a polynomial and examining the $\lambda^2$ coefficient clarifies the sum-over-intermediate-states formula: it is the second derivative of $E$ with respect to $\lambda$.

## Quick Practice

1. **Binomial in QM.** The relativistic energy is $E = mc^2/\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}$. Use $(1+x)^n \approx 1+nx$ with $x = -v^2/c^2$ and $n = -1/2$ to recover the Newtonian kinetic energy $\frac{1}{2}mv^2$ as the leading correction. What is the next term, and when does it matter?

2. **Perturbation validity check.** A hydrogen atom is placed in a weak electric field $\mathcal{E}$ (the Stark effect). State the condition on $\mathcal{E}$ for first-order perturbation theory to be valid, in terms of the matrix element $\langle n\ell m|z|n'\ell'm'\rangle$ and the energy spacing. What goes wrong at exact degeneracy?

3. **Taylor as a tool.** The Morse potential near equilibrium $r_0$ is $V(r) = D_e(1 - e^{-\alpha(r-r_0)})^2$. Expand $V$ to second order in $u = r - r_0$ and identify the effective spring constant $k_\text{eff} = 2D_e\alpha^2$, hence $\omega = \alpha\sqrt{2D_e/m}$. Where does the harmonic approximation fail?
