# Module M-03 — Ordinary Differential Equations and Boundary Conditions
*When you need this: the time-independent Schrödinger equation is a second-order linear ODE, and every 1D bound-state and scattering problem in QM Vol. I Chs. 4–7 is solved by the methods here.*

The moment you write down the time-independent Schrödinger equation for a particle in a box, you have written down a second-order ordinary differential equation. Everything that follows — the allowed energies, the wave functions, the nodes, the quantization — flows from solving that equation subject to boundary conditions. None of it is mysterious once you understand the ODE. All of it is mysterious until you do.

A differential equation for a function $u(x)$ is an equation relating $u$ to its own derivatives. Its solution is a function — a whole curve, not a number — determined up to free constants that get fixed by boundary or initial conditions. A **second-order** ODE contains $u''$ as the highest derivative; its general solution always has exactly two free constants. This is not a coincidence: it reflects the physical fact that specifying a particle's position and momentum at one point determines its entire trajectory under Newton's law, which is also a second-order equation.

## The Characteristic-Equation Method

The central form in quantum mechanics is:

$$u'' + pu' + qu = 0, \qquad p, q \in \mathbb{R} \text{ (constants)}.$$

This equation is **linear**: no term has $u$ or its derivatives raised to a power higher than one. Linearity purchases **superposition**: if $u_1$ and $u_2$ are both solutions, then $Au_1 + Bu_2$ is also a solution for any constants $A$ and $B$. The two-parameter family $Au_1 + Bu_2$ is the general solution.

The characteristic-equation method, due to Euler in the 1740s, works as follows. Assume $u = e^{rx}$, so $u' = re^{rx}$ and $u'' = r^2e^{rx}$. Substitute into the ODE and divide by $e^{rx}$, which is never zero:

$$r^2 + pr + q = 0.$$

This is a polynomial in $r$ — the **characteristic equation**. Solve the quadratic; the roots $r_1$ and $r_2$ determine the solution family. The discriminant $\Delta = p^2 - 4q$ governs which of three cases applies:

**Two distinct real roots** ($\Delta > 0$): $u = Ae^{r_1 x} + Be^{r_2 x}$.

**Complex conjugate roots** ($\Delta < 0$): write $r = \alpha \pm i\beta$. Then $u = e^{\alpha x}(A\cos\beta x + B\sin\beta x)$.

**Repeated real root** ($\Delta = 0$): $u = (A + Bx)e^{r_0 x}$.

The method is algorithmic. Propose an exponential, substitute, get a polynomial, solve it. The solution can be verified by differentiating and plugging back in — no trust required.

## The Two Solution Families in Quantum Mechanics

In quantum mechanics, the potential $V(x)$ carves the real line into regions where $E > V$ and regions where $E < V$. The TISE has a different character in each.

**Oscillatory solution: classically allowed region ($E > V$).**

$$u'' = -k^2 u, \qquad k^2 = \frac{2m(E-V)}{\hbar^2} > 0.$$

Characteristic equation: $r^2 + k^2 = 0$, roots $r = \pm ik$. General solution in two equivalent bases:

$$u(x) = A\cos(kx) + B\sin(kx) \quad\text{(trigonometric basis)}$$
$$= Ce^{ikx} + De^{-ikx} \quad\text{(exponential basis)}$$

Both span the same two-dimensional space. The trigonometric basis is natural when boundary conditions are at specific points (a boundary condition $u(0) = 0$ immediately kills the cosine). The exponential basis is natural for traveling waves and scattering states.

**Evanescent solution: classically forbidden region ($E < V$).**

$$u'' = +\kappa^2 u, \qquad \kappa^2 = \frac{2m(V-E)}{\hbar^2} > 0.$$

Characteristic equation: $r^2 - \kappa^2 = 0$, roots $r = \pm\kappa$. General solution:

$$u(x) = Ae^{\kappa x} + Be^{-\kappa x}.$$

Both terms are present inside a finite forbidden region. Only when the forbidden region is semi-infinite — extending to $x \to +\infty$, say — does normalizability kill the growing term $e^{\kappa x}$, because it diverges.

The pattern: the sign of $E - V$ determines which case applies. This is the same discriminant logic as the three damping regimes of the classical oscillator, with the quantum allowed and forbidden regions mapping onto the classical underdamped (oscillatory) and overdamped (real-exponential) regimes respectively.

## Boundary Conditions and Quantization

Here is a fact that is easy to miss the first time through: **the ODE is satisfied for every value of $E$**. The general solution $Ae^{ikx} + Be^{-ikx}$ exists for any positive $E > V$. There is nothing in the equation itself that restricts $E$ to a discrete set.

Quantization comes from boundary conditions. The logic is:

1. The ODE generates a continuous two-parameter family of solutions at each $E$.
2. Physical boundary conditions — $\psi = 0$ at an infinite wall, $\psi \to 0$ as $x \to \pm\infty$ — are additional constraints.
3. For generic $E$, no solution satisfies all the boundary conditions simultaneously.
4. Only at specific values $E_n$ (the **eigenvalues**) does a non-trivial, physically acceptable solution exist.

A student who stares at the ODE and expects to read off the energy spectrum has the causation backwards. The ODE provides the solution families; the boundary conditions select the allowed $E$.

**Matching conditions at potential interfaces.** At a finite step in the potential, both $\psi(x)$ and $\psi'(x)$ must be continuous. This gives two matching conditions at each interface. Combined with the boundary conditions at the edges, the resulting linear system has non-trivial solutions only for specific $E$ values.

If the potential has an infinite jump — the infinite square well — only $\psi$ is matched (to zero at the wall); $\psi'$ may be discontinuous there. The physical reason: a finite-step potential can supply only finite force, requiring $\psi'$ to be continuous; an infinite-step potential can supply an infinite impulse and allows $\psi'$ to jump.

## Worked Example: The Infinite Square Well

The TISE inside the well ($0 < x < L$, $V = 0$):

$$\psi'' = -k^2\psi, \qquad k^2 = \frac{2mE}{\hbar^2}.$$

Characteristic equation: $r^2 + k^2 = 0$, roots $r = \pm ik$. General solution:

$$\psi(x) = A\sin(kx) + B\cos(kx).$$

**Boundary condition at $x = 0$:** $\psi(0) = B = 0$. So $\psi(x) = A\sin(kx)$.

**Boundary condition at $x = L$:** $\psi(L) = A\sin(kL) = 0$. For $A \neq 0$: $kL = n\pi$, $n = 1, 2, 3, \ldots$

Allowed wave numbers: $k_n = n\pi/L$.

Allowed energies:

$$\boxed{E_n = \frac{\hbar^2 k_n^2}{2m} = \frac{n^2\pi^2\hbar^2}{2mL^2}.}$$

The constant $A$ is fixed separately by normalization, not by the ODE or boundary conditions.

The energy grows as $n^2$ — a result that follows directly from $k_n = n\pi/L$ and $E \propto k^2$. The discreteness is not put in by hand; it emerges from requiring a standing wave to fit exactly $n$ half-wavelengths into the box. The physics is entirely in the ODE plus boundary conditions.

## Where These Methods Appear in the Quantum Series

**Vol. I, Ch. 4 — The time-independent Schrödinger equation.** The TISE is a second-order linear ODE in $x$. The strategy — write it as $\psi'' = f(x)\psi$, identify the sign of $f$, write the appropriate general solution, apply boundary conditions, extract $E_n$ — is the characteristic-equation method of this module. Ch. I·4 introduces it as the universal machine for 1D quantum mechanics.

**Vol. I, Ch. 5 — The infinite square well.** The worked example above, carried to completion with normalization. The key insight — that quantization emerges from the boundary conditions $\psi(0) = \psi(L) = 0$, not from any special property of the ODE — is the eigenvalue idea of this module.

**Vol. I, Ch. 6 — The quantum harmonic oscillator.** The QHO TISE is not constant-coefficient — the coefficient of $\psi$ depends on $x$ — so the characteristic-equation method applies only asymptotically ($|x| \to \infty$, where $x^2$ dominates). The large-$|x|$ analysis gives $\psi \sim e^{-m\omega x^2/2\hbar}$, the normalizable choice. One then substitutes $\psi(x) = H(x)\,e^{-m\omega x^2/2\hbar}$ and finds that $H(x)$ must satisfy Hermite's equation. The termination condition for the resulting series — that $H(x)$ must be a polynomial to preserve normalizability — is the QHO's eigenvalue condition. The foundation is the same ODE logic; the technique is extended to non-constant coefficients.

**Vol. I, Ch. 7 — The finite square well and scattering states.** The finite square well has three regions: interior ($|x| < a$, oscillatory) and exterior ($|x| > a$, evanescent for bound states). The general solution is written in each region; $\psi$ and $\psi'$ are matched at $x = \pm a$. The four matching equations plus normalizability conditions reduce to a transcendental equation for the allowed energies. This is the two-solution-family picture plus matching conditions.

For **scattering states** ($E > 0$), both regions have oscillatory solutions. The matching conditions at the interfaces give transmission and reflection amplitudes; the transmission probability $T = |t|^2$ where $t$ is the ratio of transmitted to incident complex amplitude. The exponential basis $e^{\pm ikx}$ is natural here — traveling waves, not standing waves.

**Vol. III, Ch. 5 — WKB approximation.** The WKB approximation treats the TISE as locally constant-coefficient in each infinitesimal region, with local wave number $k(x) = \sqrt{2m(E - V(x))}/\hbar$ varying slowly from point to point. In a classically allowed region the solution is $\psi \approx A(x)\,e^{i\int k\,dx}$. In a forbidden region, $k(x) \to i\kappa(x)$ and the solution is evanescent. At a **turning point** ($E = V(x_0)$, $k = 0$), neither approximation holds and the two WKB solutions must be connected by **connection formulas** derived from the exact solution near the turning point (typically Airy functions). The whole WKB framework is the constant-coefficient solution family of this module applied patchwork, with connection formulas stitching the regions together.

## Conventions and Pitfalls

**The sign of the $\psi''$ coefficient determines oscillatory vs. evanescent.** Write the TISE as $\psi'' = f(x)\psi$. If $f < 0$ (i.e., $E > V$): oscillatory, use $\sin$ and $\cos$. If $f > 0$ (i.e., $E < V$): evanescent, use $e^{\pm\kappa x}$. The sign is determined by the sign of $E - V$, which changes at the classical turning points.

**Both constants are needed inside a finite well.** Inside a finite square well the solution is oscillatory, and both $\sin(kx)$ and $\cos(kx)$ appear in the general solution. Students sometimes drop the cosine by analogy with the infinite well, where a boundary condition at $x = 0$ forces it out. In the finite well there is no such boundary condition at the center — both terms survive until the matching conditions at the edges are applied.

**Two separate steps: boundary conditions, then normalization.** The ODE gives a two-parameter family; boundary conditions fix one or both constants and select the eigenvalue $E_n$; normalization fixes the remaining overall amplitude. These are sequential, not simultaneous. Normalizing before applying boundary conditions is a common source of confusion.

**Continuity of $\psi'$ is required at every finite step.** At a finite discontinuity in $V$, both $\psi$ and $\psi'$ must match. At an infinite wall, only $\psi$ matches (to zero); $\psi'$ may jump. Forgetting to match $\psi'$ — not just $\psi$ — is the most common error in finite-well and barrier problems.

**Quantization from boundary conditions, not the ODE.** The ODE is satisfied for every value of $E > V_\text{min}$. Discrete energy levels emerge only when the boundary conditions are imposed. A student who looks at the ODE and expects to read off the energy spectrum has the causation backwards.

## Quick Practice

1. Show by direct substitution that $\psi(x) = A\sin(kx) + B\cos(kx)$ satisfies $\psi'' = -k^2\psi$. Then apply the boundary conditions $\psi(0) = 0$ and $\psi(L) = 0$ and find the allowed values of $k$ for $A \neq 0$.

2. For the TISE in a region where $V > E$ (classically forbidden), write the general solution. A particle is in the region $x > 0$ only, with $\psi(x) \to 0$ as $x \to +\infty$. Which term in the general solution survives, and why?

3. Write the general solution in each of three regions for a finite square well: region I ($x < -a$), region II ($-a < x < a$, $V = -V_0$), and region III ($x > a$). List the four matching conditions at $x = \pm a$ without solving them. Count: how many equations, how many unknowns (the free constants), and what does this imply about when a non-trivial solution exists?
